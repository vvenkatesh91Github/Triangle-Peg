# Triangle-Peg
Board puzzle game

Triangular peg solitaire is a popular puzzle most commonly played on the 15-hole board.

The game is played in a similar fashion to regular (square lattice) peg solitaire. Start from a position with one hole open and jump one peg over another, removing the peg that was jumped over. The goal is to finish at a board position with only one peg. Jumps are allowed along three directions parallel to the edges of the board. Each peg has a maximum of six neighbors, while in square solitaire there can be at most four. These are only minor differences, as we shall see, and the theory of the game is very similar.
